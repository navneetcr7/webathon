<div id=Array>
   <h1 align=center>ARRAYS</h1>
   <p>An array is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in the array is identified by an index or a key, starting from zero. This index signifies the position of the element within the array. The primary advantage of arrays lies in their direct access to elements based on their indices, which enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.</p>

<p>Arrays can store various types of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or even custom objects. The fixed-size nature of arrays ensures that elements occupy consecutive memory locations, facilitating quick and predictable access. This characteristic makes arrays particularly useful for tasks where data needs to be organized in a linear and ordered fashion.</p>

<p>While arrays offer fast access to elements, their size is typically fixed at the time of declaration. This inflexibility can be a limitation in scenarios where dynamic resizing is necessary. Despite this, arrays are fundamental in programming and serve as building blocks for more complex data structures and algorithms. They are essential for tasks ranging from basic list management to sophisticated numerical computations.</p>

</div>

<div id=Stack>
   <h1 align=center>STACKS</h1>
   <p>A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It behaves like a collection of elements where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates—new plates are added to the top, and the one at the top is the first to be taken off.</p>

<p>A stack has two primary operations:</p>

<p>Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.</p>
<p>Pop: Removing the element from the top of the stack.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of a stack is that it only allows access to the topmost element, preventing direct access to elements in the middle. This simplicity makes stacks efficient for managing data in a specific order, such as tracking function calls in computer memory or handling the undo feature in applications.</p>

<p>Stacks are widely used in programming for tasks like managing function calls and recursion, parsing expressions, and maintaining state information. They are a crucial component in various algorithms and applications, providing a straightforward and efficient way to organize and control the flow of data.</p>

</div>

<div id=Queue>
   <h1 align=center>QUEUE</h1>
   <p>A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, elements are added at the rear (enqueue operation), and they are removed from the front (dequeue operation). Picture a queue of people waiting in line—the person who arrives first is the first to be served.</p>

<p>Key operations in a queue:</p>

<p>Enqueue: Adding an element to the rear of the queue.</p>
<p>Dequeue: Removing the element from the front of the queue.</p>
<p>Queues are used in scenarios where tasks need to be processed in the order they are received. They are prevalent in various computer science applications, such as job scheduling in operating systems, breadth-first search algorithms, and managing tasks in a printer queue. Queues provide an orderly way to handle data, ensuring that the oldest elements are processed or served first.</p>

</div>

<div id=Linkedlist>
   <h1 align=center>LINKED LIST</h1>
   <p>A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, making them dynamic in size and efficient for insertions and deletions.</p>

<p>There are two primary types of linked lists:</p>

<p>Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.</p>

<p>Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes, allowing for easier traversal in both directions.</p>

<p>Key operations in a linked list:</p>

<p>Insertion: Adding a new node.</p>
<p>Deletion: Removing a node.</p>
<p>Traversal: Visiting each node sequentially.</p>
<p>Linked lists are useful when the size of the data structure is unknown or may change frequently. They offer advantages in terms of memory utilization and flexibility. However, accessing elements in a linked list is not as direct as in an array, as traversal from the head (start) to the desired node is necessary. Linked lists are commonly employed in various applications, such as dynamic memory allocation, implementation of data structures like stacks and queues, and as the underlying structure for more complex data structures.</p>

</div>

<div id=Tree>
   <h1 align=center>TREES</h1>
   <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is composed of a root node, which has no parent, and each non-root node has a parent node and can have child nodes. Nodes with no children are called leaves. The structure of a tree resembles an inverted tree with the root at the top and branches extending downwards.</p>

<p>Key elements of a tree:</p>

<p>Root: The topmost node with no parent.</p>
<p>Node: Represents an element in the tree.</p>
<p>Edge: Connection between nodes.</p>
<p>Parent: A node that has child nodes.</p>
<p>Child: Nodes connected to a parent node.</p>
<p>Leaf: A node with no children.</p>
<p>Types of trees:</p>

<p>Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.</p>
<p>Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with the property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.</p>
<p>Balanced Tree: Ensures that the depth of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes, ensuring efficient operations.</p>
<p>Binary Heap: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.</p>
<p>Trees are widely used in computer science for organizing hierarchical relationships, representing hierarchical structures in databases, implementing file systems, and serving as the basis for various search and traversal algorithms. The hierarchical nature of trees makes them versatile and suitable for representing relationships and hierarchies in diverse applications.</p>

</div>

<div id=Graph>
   <h1 align=center>GRAPHS</h1>
   <p>A graph is a versatile data structure that consists of a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Unlike trees, graphs may have cycles, and edges can have direction (directed graph) or be undirected. Graphs are used to model relationships and connections between various entities.</p>

<p>Key components of a graph:</p>

<p>Vertex (Node): Represents an entity in the graph.</p>
<p>Edge: Connects two vertices and may have a direction (directed) or not (undirected).</p>
<p>Weight: A numerical value associated with an edge, indicating a cost or distance.</p>
<p>Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.</p>
<p>Types of graphs:

<p>Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a specific direction, indicating a one-way connection.</p>
<p>Undirected Graph: Edges have no specific direction, representing two-way connections.</p>
<p>Weighted Graph: Edges have associated numerical values, representing weights.</p>
<p>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): A directed graph without cycles.</p>
<p>Applications of graphs:</p>

<p>Networks: Modeling social networks, computer networks, and transportation systems.</p>
<p>Pathfinding Algorithms: Finding the shortest path between two vertices.</p>
<p>Dependency Resolution: Representing dependencies between tasks or modules.</p>
<p>Circuit Design: Analyzing and optimizing electronic circuits.</p>
<p>Recommendation Systems: Modeling user-item relationships in recommendation algorithms.</p>
<p>Graphs provide a powerful and flexible framework for representing and analyzing complex relationships and dependencies in various domains, making them a fundamental concept in computer science and related fields.</p>
